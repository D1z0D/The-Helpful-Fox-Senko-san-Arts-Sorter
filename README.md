# The-Helpful-Fox-Senko-san-Arts-Sorter
Do you have a folder with 3000 Senko, Shiro and Sora pictures? Just pass it to the script and it will sort your images!

This is a simple script with a trained "YOLO" model. The input is a folder with images and the path to the final folder where the sorting will be performed.
